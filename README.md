# column-aligner README

This extention adds a shortcut key (by default, `Shift-Alt-\` or `Shift-Cmd-\`) that will attempt to align the selected text to the nearest tab stop column to your cursor position.

This is useful in languages like SQL, where you may want to align code with tabs or spaces for readability.

## Features

- Works with multi-line selections
- Works with multi-cursor selections
- Respects your tab width and expansion settings
